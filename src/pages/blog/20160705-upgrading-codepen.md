[096:Upgrading Rails](https://blog.codepen.io/2016/06/28/096-upgrading-rails/)

You may have seen our ad in Ruby Weekly advertising our site [UpgradeRails.com](https://www.upgraderails.com/). In response to our ad, the fine folks over at [CodePen.io](http://codepen.io/) got in touch with us and threw down the gauntlet: upgrade CodePen from Rails 3.2 to Rails 4.2.

After analyzing CodePen's codebase and determining that the upgrade was within their budget, we got to work. The end result: we crushed it!

They were so happy with our work that they invited our very own cofounder and creator of Upgrade Rails, [Joshua Wood](https://twitter.com/joshuap), onto their weekly podcast to talk about the upgrade. During the podcast CodePen cofounder Tim Sabat summarized it best:

> “This is the perfect thing for us to consult on… we can be building user facing features while [Hint] can be working hard in the background.” - Tim Sabat
