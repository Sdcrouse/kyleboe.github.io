		<div class="title">First Day on the Jobs</div>
		<div class="date-time">Mar 30, 2015, 3:39 PM PDT</div>
		<div class="text">Today has been excellent. Started off with a meeting at Gazelles going over their current stack for a system that I am updating for them. Then I spent the afternoon at Clearsight Studio working with the guys over her to knock out support tickets. In both spots, I am still just getting my legs under me and figuring out what my daily/weekly routine looks like but so far so good. On a side note, I should probably actually put some effort into the styling on this site. So if anyone actually visits it, they know that I can do styling.</div>

		<div class="title">Contract Work Aplenty</div>
		<div class="date-time">Mar 28, 2015, 5:40 PM PDT</div>
		<div class="text">The past couple days have been pretty crazy. I have been looking for work for about 2 months now with no luck. This last week I had been offered some contract work for a company in Vancouver. They sent the paperwork over to me a few days ago and I got it finalized and back to them on Wednesday. The moment I sent the response email with the finalized paperwork, I recieved a facebook message with a job offer. The friend's dad who offered me the job asked me to come in as soon as I could for a small interview/introduction. I immediately went to their office for said interview/introduction and while I was there, I recieved a message about more potential contract work. It left me pretty speechless after looking for work so long and then suddenly having the opportunity to work three jobs. I ended up having to turn down one of the jobs simply because of there being only so many hours in a day. I am so excited to finally be back working.</div>

		<div class="title">Post-LAN Recap</div>
		<div class="date-time">Mar 24, 2015, 11:54 PM PDT</div>
		<div class="text">This last Friday I helped put on a LAN party at New Heights church. My sleep schedule hasn't recovered yet. I have kinda failed the day after the LAN on programming every day, but I figure taking Sunday off isn't so bad. Also, here is a time lapse of the LAN: <div id="fb-root"></div><script>(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.0";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script><div class="fb-post" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=815714698506592" data-width="500"><div class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"><blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=815714698506592"><p>Here is a time lapse of the Spring LAN!</p>Posted by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/newheightsLAN">NHLM</a> on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=815714698506592">Monday, March 23, 2015</a></blockquote></div></div></div>

		<div class="title">Day 4: I have done nothing</div>
		<div class="date-time">Mar 19, 2015, 4:00 PM PDT</div>
		<div class="text">So this is day four of me coding every day and essentially day one of me writing in this journal/blog/mental dump. I am trying to develop my skills as a developer as well as build some more structured habits into my life. Most of these post will be stream of consciousness and without spellcheck (I am writing everything in Sublime Text). Also, the subject matter will probably vary wildly. Anything from news, to programming, to video games, to music, and more. </br></br> My current project is working on a twitch chat bot for a <a href="http://nhlm.org">LAN party group</a> that I started here in Vancouver, WA. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/kyleboe/RoRTwitchChatBot">repo</a> and feel free to comment. </div>
